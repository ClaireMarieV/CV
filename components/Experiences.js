                Complete production of a 30-seconds animated title sequence in a
                solarpunk sci-fi universe, handled independently over 10 weeks.
                Created the full pre-production package (research, visual
                universe, storyboard, styleframes), followed by art direction,
                3D/2D animation, compositing, editing, and color grading.
                Multi-software pipeline including Blender (Eevee) for 3D
                animation, After Effects for 2D animation and compositing, and
                DaVinci Resolve for editing and grading. 7 scenes created, with
                3+ stylized transitions and full integration of HUD and motion
                design elements.

                  Since I had a tight deadline, to save time, I used Blender's
                  modifiers (Mirror, Subdivision Surface, Array) to speed up the
                  modeling process. I also employed procedural modeling
                  techniques to make adjustments without losing previous work
                  and adjusted the render samples in Cycles. For this, I used
                  denoising (OptiX, OpenImageDenoise) to achieve faster results
                  by reducing the sample count. I repeated the same object
                  multiple times to save time and improve efficiency. And
                  finally, I used pre-established libraries to quickly apply
                  consistent materials to my models. It reducing production time
                  by 30%.
